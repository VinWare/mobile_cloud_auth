# mobile_cloud_auth

A Rust project to create a mobile cloud authentication system

An implementation based on the research article https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/4520685, along with a custom elliptic curve implementation.

Currently, elliptic curve module is a part of this project itself, I plan to move it to a separate repo after this is well ahead.
